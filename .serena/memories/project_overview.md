- Purpose: Go 1.25.4 monorepo workspace (cocotola-1.25) demonstrating Bazel (rules_go, Gazelle, rules_pkg, rules_oci) setup with multiple Go applications and libraries.
- Main Applications:
  - cocotola-app: Main application server
  - cocotola-auth: Authentication/authorization service with OpenAPI integration, guest authentication, and RBAC helpers
  - cocotola-init: Initialization service
  - cocotola-empty: Empty/template application
  - hello-world: Sample binary for testing
  - third-party-library: Third-party library demonstration
- Libraries:
  - cocotola-lib: Shared library with domain logic, gateways, services, controllers, config, process, and testlib modules
- Structure: Root Go module plus nested modules per application; Bazel config via `MODULE.bazel`, `.bazelrc`, `.bazelignore`, and per-target BUILD files; Go workspaces (`go.work`) stitch modules together.
- Infrastructure: Docker Compose setups for MySQL (test/local), Jaeger (local), OpenAPI spec management, and test coverage reporting.
- Tooling: Uses Bazelisk for Bazel commands; Gazelle for BUILD file generation; Task for common operations; golangci-lint for code quality; pre-commit hooks for commit message validation (Conventional Commits); Docker for containerization; OpenAPI Generator for API model generation.
- Recent Features: Personal/private space support, guest authentication, RBAC helpers, scenario testing framework.
